# 2016_finals_simulator_v1
This is the first significant project I ever made. It was written in C++, and it is far from perfect. It was an idea I had that I created during exam season, so it isn't very fleshed out, but it had players taking realistic shots. I hope to make a new version coded in python with features such as rebounding, turnovers, timeouts, and adaptive plays.
